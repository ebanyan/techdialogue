'Don't put all your eggs in one basket' is a piece of advice that most investment
professionals use. The same advice is applicable in any professional
career and more so with technology professionals. An interesting statement since it depends on many things (not necessarily in any particular order):

- How fast the technologies have changed.
- How fast you can keep up with the changes in technologies.
- Opportunities you have gotten or missed.
- Relationship(s) with network of professionals you have built over a period 
  of time
- Technologies or domains that you were introduced / exposed to especially in 
  the early stages of your career life.
- Your personality:
  - Are you a people’s person, good team player, wicked smart, good listener, delegator, procrastinator, GTD by hook or crook type, and much more. 
- The company you are associated with. If you break it down further:
    - It depends on your manager, managers up in the chain till CEO
    - The industry your company is in. Rather how well the company is doing relative to other companies in the same segment
    - Product / service you are associated with along with the group
    - Team / group / company culture.
- Changes or transitions in your professional life.
- How wages / salaries have increased over a period of time 

I am sure you agree with me that what I have listed above is just a small list.

If you are an experienced software developer/engineer, QA, lead, architect, manager, any role that you are associated with your company in whatever capacity, or simply put ‘an experienced technology professional’,  then it is time for you to start thinking of engaging in additional avenues without any conflict of interest with the company. Sounds like the phrase ‘Don’t rock the boat’. Doesn’t it?

I hope you are with me and this blog is just for you to start thinking about it. In the next few blogs I will be sharing some ideas as to how you can be engaged in addition to your job. In the meantime I just wanted to plant the thought so you can start talking to your friends, colleagues and explore other avenues in addition to your day job.

This podcast / platform is primarily meant for sharing valuable lessons one has learnt, building out the network passively, brainstorm ideas to advance in one’s professional, or even a sounding board.
